# Fundamentals-of-Artificial-Intelligence
All tasks and notebooks I made during Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence course at AGH University of Krakow. <br>
All content is in polish.

### Laboratory Objectives  

#### Lab1  
**Goal**: Familiarize students with the typical process of creating machine learning models in artificial intelligence, based on simple algorithms: linear and logistic regression, with and without regularization.  

#### Lab2  
**Goal**: Present advanced machine learning methods: decision trees, random forests, and boosting. Discuss the challenges of hyperparameter tuning and model explainability.  

#### Lab3  
**Goal**: Introduce the fundamentals of machine learning using neural networks.  

#### Lab4  
**Goal**: Explore applications of neural networks in image recognition.  

#### Lab5  
**Goal**: Tackle an advanced problem in natural language processing (NLP): question answering.  

#### Lab6  
**Goal**: Study decision-making algorithms and their applications in simple games.  

#### Lab7  
**Goal**: Examine algorithms used in recommender systems.
